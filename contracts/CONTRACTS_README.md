# Vehicle Data Marketplace Smart Contracts

A modular blockchain-based vehicle data marketplace where vehicles have dedicated Ethereum wallets and can sell access to their telemetry data through smart contracts.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of three core smart contracts:

1. **VehicleRegistry.sol** - Vehicle registration and on-chain identity management
2. **DataMarketplace.sol** - Data product listings, purchases, and payments
3. **AccessControl.sol** - Session management and access control

## üìã Features

### Vehicle Registry
- **Vehicle Registration**: Each vehicle gets a unique on-chain identity linked to a dedicated wallet
- **Metadata Management**: Store vehicle details, data types, and IPFS metadata hashes
- **Access Control**: Only vehicle owners can update their vehicle information
- **Registration Fees**: Configurable registration fees paid to the platform

### Data Marketplace
- **Product Listings**: Vehicles can list data products with pricing and duration limits
- **Purchase Logic**: Buyers pay in ETH for time-limited access to data streams
- **Automated Payouts**: Payments automatically routed to vehicle wallets minus platform fees
- **Streaming Payments**: Support for continuous payment streams based on usage
- **Platform Fees**: Configurable platform fee percentage (max 10%)

### Access Control
- **Session Management**: Create and manage time-limited access sessions
- **Request Tracking**: Monitor data access requests and usage patterns
- **Concurrent Limits**: Configurable maximum concurrent sessions per user
- **Session Extension**: Extend sessions when additional access is purchased

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run tests with verbosity
forge test -vv

# Run specific test file
forge test --match-path test/VehicleRegistry.t.sol

# Run with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report
```

Test files:
- `VehicleRegistry.t.sol` - Vehicle registration and management tests
- `DataMarketplace.t.sol` - Marketplace functionality and payment tests
- `AccessControl.t.sol` - Session management and access control tests

## üí° Usage Examples

### Register a Vehicle

```solidity
string[] memory dataTypes = ["GPS", "Diagnostics", "Fuel"];
vehicleRegistry.registerVehicle{value: 0.01 ether}(
    "1HGCM82633A004352", // VIN
    vehicleWallet,       // Dedicated wallet address
    "Tesla",            // Manufacturer
    "Model 3",          // Model
    2023,              // Year
    dataTypes,         // Available data types
    "QmIPFSHash..."    // IPFS metadata hash
);
```

### List a Data Product

```solidity
dataMarketplace.listDataProduct(
    vehicleId,
    "GPS",                    // Data type
    0.001 ether,             // Price per hour
    3600,                    // Minimum duration (1 hour)
    86400,                   // Maximum duration (24 hours)
    "Real-time GPS data",    // Description
    "https://api.example.com/gps" // API endpoint
);
```

### Purchase Data Access

```solidity
// Purchase 2 hours of access
dataMarketplace.purchaseDataAccess{value: 0.002 ether}(
    productId,
    7200  // 2 hours in seconds
);
```

### Create Access Session

```solidity
bytes32 sessionKey = accessControl.createAccessSession(productId, buyer);
```

## üîß Configuration

### Platform Settings

- **Registration Fee**: Default 0.01 ETH (configurable by owner)
- **Platform Fee Rate**: Default 2.5% (max 10%, configurable by owner)
- **Max Concurrent Sessions**: Default 3 (configurable by owner)
- **Session Timeout Buffer**: Default 5 minutes (configurable by owner)

### Gas Optimization

The contracts are optimized for gas efficiency:
- Packed structs for storage efficiency
- Batch operations where possible
- Efficient access pattern checking
- Minimal external calls

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Vehicle Wallets**: Each vehicle must have a dedicated wallet address that can receive ETH payments
2. **IPFS Integration**: Vehicle metadata should be stored on IPFS with hashes stored on-chain
3. **API Endpoints**: Off-chain data access APIs should validate session keys before serving data
4. **Time-based Access**: All access durations are in seconds, with timestamps used for validation
5. **Payment Flow**: Payments are automatically split between vehicle wallets and platform fees
